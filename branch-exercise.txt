Branching Exercise

Part 1

1) "Git Branch <Desired Branch Name>" creates a new branch.

2) A fast forward merge is one that is done automatically by Git. A recursive merge requires human input to decide which changes are to be kept due to merge conflicts.

3) "Git Checkout <Existing Branch Name>" allows changing to another branch.

4) "Git Branch -d <Existing Branch Name>" deletes a branch ("-D" is required if desiring to delete branch and all commits that have not been merged or transferred.

5) A merge conflict occurs when two or more similar files on branches being merged have commits that are not clear in their chronological order.
